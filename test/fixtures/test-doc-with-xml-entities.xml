Its been a very interesting ride these last four and a half years here.  I received an offer from UBS, but decided to turn it down for personal reasons.  These last few weeks I have been with the estate working on selling certain assets.  Tomorrow is my last day with the estate and then I am off to Ohio and Cinergy to continue trading but for Cinergy.  I will also begin to learn the oprations of Cinergy as well as go back and get an executive MBA at Chicago.  Ultimately, learn more about the overall operations and risk management.  I just wanted to thank you for all you have done while I have been here.  I look back and think that I should have spent time in the pipeline group.  Even after all that has happened I certainly wouldn't change what I have experienced.  Thanks again for being such a &#13;
